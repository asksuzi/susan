  <p><h3>About Me</h3></p> &nbsp; <img src="./images/IMG_0045 (1).jpeg" height="200"/>
  <h4><p> I'm <a style="font-size: 20px; color: #058224;">Susan</a> a newcomer to the world of development and eager to learn and gain experience in this field &#128522;.</p>
  <p>Before this, I was an elementary school teacher. I have a deep passion for hiking and mountain climbingâ€”mountains are my happy place &#x26f0;â›°.</p>
  <p>I recently moved to Italy 	ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¹ and am currently studying wellness, sports, and health. I'm also an introverted and somewhat shy person &#128522;.</p></h4>
